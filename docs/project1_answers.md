### 1 - Registration and staff meeting
- We acknowledge that we submitted the registration form 
- We met with Ravi on his office hour on October 16th (at approximately 7:50pm)

### 2 - Dataset selection

The dataset we are going to use is the following : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/diraf0/sloan-digital-sky-survey-dr18

This dataset is the result of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, a study that archives and gathers the visible stellar objects and classifies them as Galaxies, Quasars, or Stars. 
- It has got 43 columns and more than 100 thousand rows.
- It has many continuous covariates, and one categorical for the classification of the stellar object.
- It' not a time series.
- The data is gloablly clean and no values are missing. 

This dataset is publicly accessible and under the following license : https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/
We can use it for research purpose, and will only need to give appropriate credit if we publicly share our model.

### 3 - Holdout set

We acknowledge that we have reserved 20% of the rows of our dataset.

### 4 - Outcome
For our continuous outcome, we will predict red shift, which is interesting because it determines how galaxies are distributed throughout the universe, informs us about the expansion rate of the cosmos, and contributes to our understanding of dark matter and dark energy. Additionally, redshift data can reveal galaxy properties and evolution, making it ideal for applying machine learning techniques to large datasets like the SDSS for insightful astrophysical discoveries.

- For the categorical outcome, we'll be classifying wether a stellar object is a star or not. This classification is essential for astrophysical research, allowing scientists to study the properties and distribution of stars relative to other celestial objects. With a dataset like SDSS, which provides extensive data on various objects, machine learning can efficiently differentiate stars, aiding in large-scale cosmic surveys and contributing to our broader knowledge of stellar evolution and galaxy formation.
